📊 Energy Consumption Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA

🔍 Project Overview
This project builds and compares time-series forecasting models to predict hourly energy consumption using the **PJME Hourly Energy Consumption dataset.**

The project demonstrates:
- Time-series visualization
- Linear regression modeling
- ARIMA model development
- SARIMA model development
- Model evaluation with MAE and MSE
- Forecast visualization with confidence intervals

This work supports my transition into **computational energy systems research** and demonstrates practical skills in Python-based energy forecasting.
